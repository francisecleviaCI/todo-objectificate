# Todo Objectificate

### What We're Doing

We'll be simplifying our code using objects and JSON (instead of sub-arrays and CSV), allowing us to easily implement a priority feature. Then we'll be able to add more features!


### Steps

##### In the Global Code:

* Change `todos` declaration to using a `let` each todo to `todos`, as we'll be doing some reassignment of that variable for simplicity in this project. ***Clarity***


##### `loadTodos`

We're going to change this function so that it gets our JSON instead of our CSV, fix it up so that the path is always relative, and put the data in our javascript without `.split` or any of that 2D array nonsense.

* Add `__dirname` for relative paths and the link to the correct file (json, not csv!). The first argument, the string that represents the path, should look something like this: `__dirname + '/[path to the file]'`. Make sure that the slash is in there, while the square brackets surrounding your path are, as always, just an indication that you're going to replace that whole thing with an actual value. ***Why does the change colors indication***
* Run JSON.parse on the returned string; it shoudl return an object. Much easier than all that messy CSV splitting! Get rid of all that stuff.
* Now reassign our global `todos` array to be the `todos` property on that object.
* For now, console.log our global `todos` array at the end of this function just to see if it works!


##### `saveTodos`

Going to do everything `loadTodos` did, but in reverse. Same basic structural changes, though!

* Get rid of everything before the `writeFileSync` call (which we'll change but still use).
* To the beginning of the first argument of that `writeFileSync` call, add the `__dirname` value, just as in the previous function.
* Now for making the `newContents` variable actually have a value (preferably the value we want to write). First step: create an object with a `todos` property, and set that `todos` property to be our global `todos` array.
* Next: create a `newContents` variable, and set it to the result of calling `JSON.stringify` on our object. This will give us a JSON string we can write to the file. (Feel free to look up how to add whitespace when writing to the file if you want to be able to examine that JSON file directly in your editor.)
* Now that we have a value in our `newContents` variable, our `writeFileSync` call has something to write. Let's move on!


##### `displayTodos`

Currently, we're looping through, giving each `todo` its own variable instead of the awkward `todos[i]`, and then giving each of the properties (`text`, `isComplete`, and `priority`) their own variables for clarity as well. Let's change that!

* Now that they're objects, our properties have proper names themselves. So get rid of the text, isComplete, and priority variables.
* Now we can replace them with `todo.text`, `todo.isComplete`, and `todo.priority` in the rest of the function. Shorter, more readable code. Thanks, objects!
* You can still make variables for those properties if you want with code like this:

```javascript
const text = todo.text;
```

Your mileage may vary on whether that's worth the extra lines of code!


##### The Rest

* Now you try editing the rest of our functions to match. Log out what values you're looking at when the app is not working!


##### Hints

* `add` is going to create an object to push into our todos array, based on our user's answer. Remember that `isComplete` is now a boolean (not a string we have to be careful about spelling for!), and `priority` should be... whatever you think the default priority should be.
* `remove`... could it simply stay the same? If not, what needs to change?
* For `complete` and `uncomplete`, remember that you `isComplete` is a boolean!


##### Stretch Goals

Coming soon!
